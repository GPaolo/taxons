{\itshape Py\+Bullet Gymperium is an open-\/source implementation of the Open\+AI Gym Mu\+Jo\+Co environments for use with the Open\+AI Gym Reinforcement Learning Research Platform in support of open research.}

Open\+AI gym is currently one of the most widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. Unfortunately, for several challenging continuous control environments it requires the user to install Mu\+Jo\+Co, a commercial physics engine which requires a license to run for longer than 30 days. Such a commercial barrier hinders open research, especially in the perspective that other appropriate physics engines exist. This repository provides alternative implementations of the original Mu\+Jo\+Co environments which can be used for free. The environments have been reimplemented using \href{https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3}{\tt Bullet\+Physics\textquotesingle{}} python wrapper pybullet, such that they seamlessly integrate into the Open\+AI gym framework. In order to show the usability of the new environments, several RL agents from the \href{https://github.com/reinforceio/tensorforce}{\tt Tensorforce} Reinforcement Learning Library are configured to be trainable out of the box. To simplify research with the implemented environment, each environment is featured with pretrained agents which serve as unit tests for the implementations and could well serve as baselines for other purposes.

\subsection*{Basics}

(taken from Open\+AI gym readme)

There are two basic concepts in reinforcement learning\+: the environment (namely, the outside world) and the agent (namely, the algorithm you are writing). The agent sends {\ttfamily actions} to the environment, and the environment replies with {\ttfamily observations} and {\ttfamily rewards} (that is, a score).

The core {\ttfamily gym} interface is {\ttfamily Env $<$\href{https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/core.py}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/core.\+py}$>$}\+\_\+, which is the unified environment interface. There is no interface for agents; that part is left to you. The following are the {\ttfamily Env} methods you should know\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily reset(self)}\+: Reset the environment\textquotesingle{}s state. Returns {\ttfamily observation}.
\item {\ttfamily step(self, action)}\+: Step the environment by one timestep. Returns {\ttfamily observation}, {\ttfamily reward}, {\ttfamily done}, {\ttfamily info}.
\item `render(self, mode=\textquotesingle{}human\textquotesingle{}, close=False){\ttfamily \+: Render one frame of the environment. The default mode will do something human friendly, such as pop up a window. Passing the}close` flag signals the renderer to close any such windows.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries In addition to the basic concepts of reinforcement learning, this framework extends the notion of an environment into two subconcepts being the robot (the agents directly controllable body) and the scene (all things the agents interacts with). Implementing RL environments in this way allows us to switch parts of the environment to generate new robot-\/scene combinations.}

\subsection*{Installing Pybullet-\/\+Gym}

First, you can perform a minimal installation of Open\+AI Gym with 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git
2 cd gym
3 pip install -e .
\end{DoxyCode}


Then, the easiest way to install Pybullet-\/\+Gym is to clone the repository and install locally 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym.git
2 cd pybullet-gym
3 pip install -e .
\end{DoxyCode}


Important Note\+: {\itshape Do not} use {\ttfamily python setup.\+py install} as this will not copy the assets (you might get missing S\+DF file errors).

Finally, to test installation, open python and run 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 import gym  # open ai gym
2 import pybulletgym  # register PyBullet enviroments with open ai gym
3 
4 env = gym.make('HumanoidPyBulletEnv-v0')
5 env.reset()  # should return a state vector if everything worked
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Supported systems}

We currently support Linux, Windows and OS X running Python 2.\+7 or 3.\+5.

To run {\ttfamily pip install -\/e \textquotesingle{}.\mbox{[}all\mbox{]}\textquotesingle{}}, you\textquotesingle{}ll need a semi-\/recent pip. Please make sure your pip is at least at version {\ttfamily 1.\+5.\+0}. You can upgrade using the following\+: {\ttfamily pip install -\/-\/ignore-\/installed pip}. Alternatively, you can open {\ttfamily setup.\+py $<$\href{https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/setup.py}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/openai/gym/blob/master/setup.\+py}$>$}\+\_\+ and install the dependencies by hand.

\subsection*{Agents}

As some sort of unit test for the environments, we provide pretrained agents for each environment. The agents for the roboschool envs and the mujoco were trained on the original implementations of roboschool and mujoco respectively.

\subsection*{Environments}

The code for each environment group is housed in its own subdirectory {\ttfamily gym/envs $<$\href{https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs}$>$}\+\_\+. The specification of each task is in {\ttfamily \hyperlink{external_2pybullet-gym_2pybulletgym_2envs_2____init_____8py}{gym/envs/\+\_\+\+\_\+init\+\_\+\+\_\+.\+py} $<$\href{https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/__init__.py}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/\+\_\+\+\_\+init\+\_\+\+\_\+.\+py}$>$}\+\_\+. It\textquotesingle{}s worth browsing through both.

\subsection*{Roadmap}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \mbox{[}R\+O\+B\+O\+S\+C\+H\+O\+OL G\+Y\+MS\mbox{]} The current gyms are the roboschool gyms ported to pybullet. So far, most of them work well, except for the manipulator envs striker, pusher and thrower, where the robot is not correctly loaded. This will have to be fixed with Erwin Coumans. 
\item \mbox{[}O\+P\+E\+N\+AI M\+U\+J\+O\+CO G\+Y\+MS\mbox{]} Soon I will start to port the Open\+AI gyms, which unfortunately have a slightly different observation (and probably action) vector. I can setup all the gyms quickly, but it will take a while to find out what some of observations are in mujoco and what they correspond to in pybullet. Some of the observations might not be exposed on pybullet, then we can request them, for others it is already hard to know what they are in mujoco. 
\item \mbox{[}O\+P\+E\+N\+AI R\+O\+B\+O\+T\+I\+CS G\+Y\+MS\mbox{]} Next in line would be the robotics gyms in Open\+AI. These are particularly delicate simulations and might take some tuning to even be simulatable in pybullet. 4.\mbox{[}D\+E\+E\+P\+M\+I\+ND C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+OL S\+U\+I\+TE\mbox{]} Then there is Deepmind Control Suite, another set of gyms which are in mujoco and need to be freed.
