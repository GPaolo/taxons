Python bindings for \href{https://github.com/jbmouret/libfastsim}{\tt libfastsim}.

\subsection*{Requirements }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries A c++14 capable compiler is needed !}
\item the pybind11 python module
\item the pybind11 development package (libpybind11-\/dev on Debian/\+Ubuntu)
\item libfastsim from github (\href{https://github.com/jbmouret/libfastsim}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/jbmouret/libfastsim}), patched with the provided patch. The patch does does 2 things\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adds -\/f\+P\+IC flag to compilation
\item Migrates the code from boost\+::shared\+\_\+ptr to std\+::shared\+\_\+ptr (which is much easier to use with pybind11)
\item (It also removes debug flags and make the test more verbose; that is optional)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Installation }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Just run {\ttfamily pip3 install .} from the directory
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Usage }

You can run the example with {\ttfamily python3 \hyperlink{example_8py}{example.\+py} worlds/example.\+xml} from the example repository

It is a port of the C++ test\+\_\+fastsim and should give exactly the same results.
